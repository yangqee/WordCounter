Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot, and I discovered that the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.
Well, of course it was nailed there. Otherwise, it would’ve muscled up to those bars and VOOM!
Look, matey. This parrot wouldn’t “voom” if I put four thousand volts through it. It’s bleeding demised!
It’s not! It’s pining!
It’s not pining! It’s passed on! This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be! It’s expired and gone to meet its maker! This is a late parrot! It’s a stiff! Bereft of life! It rests in peace! If you hadn’t nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies! It’s run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!
Well, I’d better replace it, then.
If you want to get anything done in this country, you’ve got to complain ‘til you’re blue in the mouth.
Sorry, guv. We’re fresh out of parrots.
I see. I get the picture.
I’ve got a slug.
Does it talk?
Not really, no.
Well, it’s scarcely a replacement then, is it?
Listen. Tell you what, if you go to my brother’s pet shop in Bolton, he’ll replace your parrot for you.
Bolton, eh?
Yeah.
Alright.
Er, excuse me. This is Bolton, isn’t it?
No, no. It’s Ipswich.
That’s Inter-City Rail for you.
I wish to make a complaint!
I don’t have to do this, you know!
I beg your pardon?
I’m a qualified brain surgeon. I only do this because I like being my own boss.
Er, excuse me. This is irrelevant, isn’t it?
Oh, yeah. It’s not easy to pad these things out to thirty minutes.
Well, I wish to make a complaint. I got on the Bolton train and found myself deposited here in Ipswich.
No, this is Bolton.
The pet shop owner’s brother was lying.
Well, you can’t blame British Rail for that.
If this is Bolton, then I shall return to the pet shop.
I understand that this is Bolton.
